                SOFTWARE LIBRARY AREA

	=======================================

Welcome to the Microsoft Software Library (MSL) Directory. You will
find the following subdirectories for your use. 


MSLFILES: Microsoft Software library (MSL) files are a subset of the
	  Microsoft Knowledge Base. The MSL contains over 2900 files 
	  comprised of various drivers, appnotes, sample code, 
          patches, large documents, and other information. 

Please read the Index.txt file in this area for the complete listing
of all Software Library files.  

The Index.txt file has the following format:

Modifyddate	softlib#	filename     	description

An example entry would be:

May 14, 1999	S40055		O97dtfix.exe	Microsoft Outlook 97 Date Fix 

The files are located in the MSLFILES directory (one directory below).

Please do not do a 'DIR' in that directory as it contains a great 
number of files, and it will take several minutes to display. The 
INDEX.TXT file mentioned above lists all of the files, and it is 
kept in synch with the contents of the MSLFILES directory.

The MSL files are either text files, zipped files, or self-extracting 
files and can *only* be obtained by their Filename and not by their 
Snumber. All Macintosh files are converted to BinHex format (.HQX)
